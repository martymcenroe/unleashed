# Session Log - 2026-02-13

## Session: mirror-strip-ansi-fix
- **Mode:** quick cleanup
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.6
- **Summary:** Implemented cursor-tracking ANSI parser (mirror_strip_ansi) to fix session mirror word spacing. DELETE mode was merging words ("Itis"), REPLACE mode was breaking characters ("C l a u d e"). New parser tracks cursor column positions to distinguish word gaps from adjacent characters.
- **Next:** Per user direction

## Session: clean-transcript-dev

- **Summary:** Built clean_transcript.py (95 garbage patterns, dedup, user extraction, --fix-spaces). Created unleashed-c-19.py with transcript save. Created unleashed-g-18.py with approval echo fix.
- **Next:** Per user direction
