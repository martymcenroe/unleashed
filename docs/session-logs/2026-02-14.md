## Session: c-21 build + CLAUDE.md audit
- **Mode:** full cleanup
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Summary:** Built unleashed-c-21.py from c-20 base with shared garbage filter (is_garbage from transcript_filters.py), 200ms rate-limited mirror writes, WebFetch permission pattern fix, and transcript auto-cleanup. Archived 12 historical files from src/ to archive/. Comprehensive CLAUDE.md audit across 18 repos (~1,100 lines removed). Instruction chain optimization moved universal rules to Projects/CLAUDE.md. Cleaned bash_profile (195→107 lines). Split MEMORY.md global vs career-scoped.
- **Next:** Per user direction
