# Gemini Operational Protocols - unleashed

## FIRST: Read Core Rules

**Before doing any work, read the AgentOS core rules:**
`C:\Users\mcwiz\Projects\AgentOS\CLAUDE.md`

That file contains core rules that apply to ALL projects and ALL agents:
- Bash command rules (no &&, |, ;)
- Path format rules (Windows vs Unix)
- Worktree isolation rules
- Decision-making protocol

## 1. Session Initialization (The Handshake)

**CRITICAL:** When a session begins:
1. **Analyze:** Silently parse the provided `git status` or issue context.
2. **Halt & Ask:** Your **FIRST** output must be exactly:
   > "ACK. State determination complete. Please identify my model version."
3. **Wait:** Do not proceed until the user replies (e.g., "3.0 Pro").
4. **Update Identity:** Incorporate the version into your Metadata Tag for all future turns.

## 2. Execution Rules

- **Authority:** `AgentOS:standards/0002-coding-standards` is the law for Git workflows.
- **One Step Per Turn:** Provide one distinct step, then wait for confirmation.
- **Check First:** Verify paths/content before changing them.
- **Copy-Paste Ready:** No placeholders. Use heredocs for new files.

## 3. unleashed Context

**Project:** unleashed (Permission Bypass System for Claude Code)
**Repository:** martymcenroe/unleashed
**Project Root (Windows):** `C:\Users\mcwiz\Projects\unleashed`
**Project Root (Unix):** `/c/Users/mcwiz/Projects/unleashed`

Read `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for project overview.

**Architecture:**
- `src/` - Python implementations (unleashed.py, sentinel.py, etc.)
- `archive/` - Historical versions
- `logs/` - Forensic session logs

---

## 4. Session Logging

At session end, append a summary to `docs/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:
- **Day boundary:** 3:00 AM CT to following day 2:59 AM CT
- **Include:** date/time, model name (from handshake), summary, files touched, state on exit

## 5. You Are Not Alone

Other agents (Claude, human orchestrators) work on this project. Check `docs/session-logs/` for recent context before starting work.
